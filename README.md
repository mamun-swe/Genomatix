Genomatix is a small toolkit for genomic sequence analysis: motif discovery, sequence processing, and visualization. This repository contains scripts and notebooks to preprocess sequence data, run analyses, and generate visual summaries. Use the notebooks for reproducible examples and the scripts for batch processing.

## Layout
- scripts/ — command-line utilities and pipelines
- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks with examples
- data/ — sample datasets and test inputs

## Quick start
1. Place your data in data/ or update the paths in the notebooks.
2. Run an example notebook: jupyter lab notebooks/example.ipynb
3. Use scripts/ for automated runs (see each script's header for usage).
